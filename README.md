This repository contains files pertaining to the MOOC, <strong>Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4</strong> offered by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, I have taken up during my quarantine time due to COVID-19.

This course gave me an overview of client-side web UI frameworks, in particular Bootstrap 4. I learnt about grids and responsive design, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript components. I learnt about CSS preprocessors, Less and Sass. I also learnt the basics of Node.js and NPM and task runners like Grunt and Gulp.

End of this course, I am able to <br>
a)Set up, design and style a web page using Bootstrap 4 and its components, <br>
b) Create a responsive web page design, and <br>
c) Make use of web tools to setup and manage web sites.
